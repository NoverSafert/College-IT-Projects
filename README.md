# College IT Projects 

The main purpose of this repository is to have a place to store all my school projects  

Projects: 

-Final Project OOP C++ 1° semester 

  The objective of this program is to show the use of different classes. 

-Final project python 1° semester 

  This program is a modification of the game Senku, originally the game is played with a cross-shaped board but my take was using a squared-shaped one instead, the main objective of the game is to have one peg left in the board. 

  The program was made to show the manipulation of a matrix in python. 

-Snakes and ladders 

  The program is trying to emulate the classic game of snakes and ladders, but the twist is that it only shows the movement of the player, not the board state. This program had the purpose to implement different objects from the same class in the same program. 

-Movie Service 

  A mockup of a movie streaming service, the function it has are: load movies, series and episodes from a file, add new movies, series or episodes, change the score of the movie.

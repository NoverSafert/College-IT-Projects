#How to play 

When you start the game, you’ll receive a board state automatically, to move you have to have a peg next to the one you want to move and then a free space, to indicate the peg that will be moved type the coordinates from 0 to 3, first the row then the column.  

After each move, you’ll be asked if you wish to continue playing, to confirm type the letter “s”, to deny type “n”.
